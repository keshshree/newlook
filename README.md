## Installation

To set up and run Newlook locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for frontend dependencies)
- Google API Key (for Gemini AI integration)

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd newlook/backend
    ```
2.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set your Google API Key:**
    The Gemini AI feature requires a Google API Key. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal session **before** running the Flask application.

    -   **Windows Command Prompt:**
        ```bash
        set GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    -   **PowerShell:**
        ```powershell
        $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    -   **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

4.  Run the Flask backend server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the root `newlook` directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  **Welcome Screen:** Upon opening `index.html`, you will be greeted by a welcome screen. Enter your name and an email address (only `@gmail.com` and `@yahoo.com` domains are accepted).
2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** After submitting your email, you will be prompted for MFA. You can either:
    *   Scan the QR code with your Google Authenticator app and enter the generated 6-digit code.
    *   **Bypass MFA for testing:** Enter `101010` as the 6-digit code.
3.  **Main Application:** Once authenticated, you will access the main application.
4.  **Navigation:** Use the burger menu icon (â˜°) in the top-left corner to open the sidebar and navigate between different services and sections.
